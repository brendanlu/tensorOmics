}
\arguments{
\item{a}{A list of tensor inputs (termed 'blocks') measured on the same
samples.}

\item{y_ind}{Index of "target" block in \code{a}.}

\item{ncomp}{The estimated number of components. ncomp must be explicitly set
as an integer in tpls.}

\item{design}{Numeric matrix of size length(x) x length(x) with values
between 0 and 1; the i,j entry in the matrix indicates the strength of the
relationship to be modelled between the i-th and j-th blocks. A value of 0
indicates no relationship, with 1 being the maximum. Alternatively, one can
input "null" for a fully disconnected design (feature blocks are only
connected to the target block at strength 1, but not to each other), or
"full" for a fully connected design (target and feature blocks are all
connected to each other equally at strength 1), or a single scalar value
between 0 and 1 which will designate the relationship between feature blocks,
with the relationships to the target block being 1. "full" by default.}

\item{scheme}{One of "horst", "factorial" or "centroid", "horst" by default.}

\item{tau}{Shrinkage constant to provide better estimate of covariance,
introduced by Ledoit and Wolf (2004). NULL by default, but can set to
"optimal" to use optimal shrinkage constants from Schafer and Strimmer
(2005), or a single scalar value between 0 and 1.}

\item{m}{A function which applies an orthogonal tensor tubal transform.}

\item{minv}{The inverse of m.}

\item{mode}{Currently supports tensor analogues of canonical, regression,
and svd PLS modes. Defaults to "regression" mode.}

\item{pairwise_scoring}{The method on which to select the face of each tensor
for each iteration of block.pls. Currently supports "top_singular" (pick
based on weighted sum of top svd diagonal value within all 2-block
combinatations), "sum_singular" (sum of diagonal values) and
"frobenius" (top_singular but approximated with the Frobenius norm
which is an upper bound). "top_singular" by default, but consider selecting
"frobenius" for speed as it avoids a full svd decomposition.}

\item{center}{If set to FALSE, the data tensor will not be centralized into
Mean Deviation Form (see Mor et al. 2022). By default, the mean horizontal
slice of the input tensor(s) are subtracted, so that all of the horizontal
slices sum to 0, analgous to centering matrix data.}

\item{tol}{Positive scalar used as convergence criteria/tolerance during the
RGCCA iterative process. Defaults to \code{1e-06}.}

\item{max_iter}{Integer specifying the maximum number of iterations to be run
for each 2D RGCCA call.}

\item{solve_dual}{For high dimensional data where n > p, use a dual
formulation in the matrix RGCCA step that works with the gram matrix instead
of the raw data. TRUE by default, only recommended to set to FALSE for
testing purposes.}

\item{bpparam}{A \link[BiocParallel]{BiocParallelParam-class} object
indicating the type of parallelisation. Does not have any effect if transform
functions explicitly set using \code{m}, \code{minv}.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\describe{
\item{ncomp}{The number of components used.}
\item{a}{The input list of centered tensor blocks.}
\item{y_ind}{The index of the target block in \code{a}.}
\item{design}{The design matrix used for block relationships.}
\item{scheme}{The RGCCA scheme used ("horst", "factorial", "centroid").}
\item{mode}{The PLS mode used ("canonical" or "regression").}
\item{pairwise_scoring}{The pairwise_scoring method used.}
\item{loadings}{List of loadings matrices per block (p_i x ncomp).}
\item{projected}{List of projected variates per block (n x ncomp).}
\item{iters}{Vector of iteration counts for each component.}
\item{faces}{Vector of selected tensor face indices per component.}
}

\note{
When \code{design = "full"}, \code{tau = 1}, setting scheme to "horst",
"factorial" or "centroid" yields method SUMCOV, SSQCOV, SABSCOV respectively.
